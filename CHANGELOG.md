# Changelog

All notable changes to PlantCare will be documented in this file.

## [0.1.0.0] - 2026-05-02

E0 Foundation & Tooling — first shippable scaffold of the V1 build. After this version, you can `git clone && bun install && bun run mobile:ios` and see a Conservatory-styled empty Plants list on a real iPhone or Simulator within ~10 minutes.

### Added
- Bun-workspace monorepo with `apps/mobile`, `apps/backend`, `packages/api-types`, `packages/theme`.
- Expo SDK 55 + Expo Router 5 mobile app aligned to the SDK manifest.
- Hono on Cloudflare Workers backend skeleton with vitest + `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers`.
- EAS development build profiles for iOS Simulator and Android device.
- CI on GitHub Actions: typecheck + jest (mobile) + vitest (backend) on every push and PR.
- Conservatory design tokens in `packages/theme` — light + Midnight dark palettes ported from `DESIGN.md`.
- Fraunces + Inter font loading via `@expo-google-fonts/*`, gated until both load to prevent system-font flash. Falls through to system fonts on load error so offline cold-start doesn't hang.
- Maestro smoke flow `.maestro/smoke-empty-plants.yaml` asserting the empty Plants list renders on launch.
- Project rules in `CLAUDE.md`, execution plan in `WORKBACK.md`, design system docs in `DESIGN.md`, master architecture plan + test plan in `plans/`, approved mockups (light + dark) in `designs/`.

### Changed
- Code review runs locally (`/codex review` + Claude adversarial via `/gstack-ship`) rather than in CI — no `OPENAI_API_KEY` repo secret needed.
